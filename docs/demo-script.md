## Example Script (Narration)

If you want to add narration:

```
"Welcome to the WorldID Reward Distribution System. 
This system prevents multi-account abuse using WorldID's 
proof of personhood.

Let me show you how it works. First, I'll browse available 
events. Here we can see several events with rewards available.

Now I'll connect my wallet to participate. [Connect wallet]

Great! My wallet is connected. Now let me join an event. 
I'll need to verify with WorldID first. [Show WorldID verification]

Perfect! I've joined the event. Now let me claim the rewards. 
I need to verify with WorldID again for this claim. [Show verification]

Excellent! The rewards have been claimed. Now let me try to 
claim again to show you how the system prevents duplicates. 
[Try to claim again]

As you can see, the system prevents me from claiming again. 
This is how we ensure fair distribution - one person, one claim.

The system also protects your privacy. We only store an 
anonymous nullifier hash, never your identity. Your privacy 
is protected while ensuring fair distribution.

Thank you for watching!"
