# Wallet Password Guide

## What Password is Being Asked?

When you click "Connect Wallet" in the application, **MetaMask** (or your wallet extension) will pop up and ask for a password. This is **NOT** a password from this application - it's your **MetaMask wallet password**.

## What is the MetaMask Password?

The MetaMask password is the password you created when you:
- **Created a new MetaMask wallet** - You set a password during wallet creation
- **Imported an existing wallet** - You set a password when importing your wallet

## Where Do I Get This Password?

### If You Remember It:
- Enter the password you set when creating/importing your MetaMask wallet
- This is the password that unlocks your MetaMask extension

### If You Forgot Your Password:

**Option 1: Reset MetaMask (if you have your seed phrase)**
1. Open MetaMask extension
2. Click the account menu (top right)
3. Go to Settings → Security & Privacy
4. Click "Reset Account"
5. Enter your **12-word seed phrase** (recovery phrase)
6. Set a new password

**⚠️ Important**: You MUST have your seed phrase to reset. If you don't have it, you cannot recover your wallet.

### If You Don't Have Your Seed Phrase:
Unfortunately, if you've forgotten your password AND don't have your seed phrase, you cannot recover your wallet. You'll need to:
1. Create a new MetaMask wallet
2. Get a new wallet address
3. Use the new wallet for this application

## Step-by-Step: Connecting Your Wallet

1. **Make sure MetaMask is installed**
   - If not, install from: https://metamask.io/download/

2. **Make sure MetaMask is unlocked**
   - Open MetaMask extension
   - Enter your wallet password to unlock it
   - Keep it unlocked while using the app

3. **Click "Connect Wallet" in the app**
   - MetaMask popup will appear
   - It may ask for your password again (for security)
   - Enter your MetaMask password

4. **Approve the connection**
   - MetaMask will ask you to approve the connection
   - Click "Connect" or "Approve"
   - Your wallet address will appear in the app

## Common Issues

### "Password is incorrect"
- Make sure you're entering your MetaMask wallet password
- Not your Google account password
- Not your computer password
- Try unlocking MetaMask extension first, then connect

### "MetaMask is locked"
- Open MetaMask extension
- Enter your password to unlock it
- Then try connecting again

### "No wallet found"

- Refresh the page
- Make sure MetaMask is enabled in your browser

## Security Note

- **Never share your MetaMask password** with anyone
- **Never share your seed phrase** with anyone
- The application never asks for your password - only MetaMask does
- This is a security feature to protect your wallet
