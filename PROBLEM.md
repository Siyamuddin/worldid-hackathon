# Problem Statement

## The Problem: Multi-Account Abuse in Reward Distribution

**One Sentence**: Event organizers and businesses lose millions to multi-account abuse where users create multiple accounts to claim rewards multiple times, making fair reward distribution impossible without proof of personhood.

## Detailed Problem Description

### The Challenge

When distributing rewards, airdrops, coupons, event merchandise, or tickets, organizers face a fundamental problem: **How do you ensure one person gets one reward?**

### Current Solutions Fail

**Traditional Solutions**:
- **Email Verification**: Easily bypassed with multiple email accounts
- **Phone Verification**: SMS services allow multiple numbers
- **KYC/Identity Verification**: Expensive, invasive, and excludes privacy-conscious users
- **IP Address Tracking**: VPNs and proxies make this useless
- **Wallet-Based**: Users can create unlimited wallets

**Result**: Organizers either:
1. Accept abuse and lose money/resources
2. Implement invasive verification that excludes users
3. Give up on fair distribution

### Real-World Impact

**Event Merchandise**:
- Limited edition items claimed by bots and multi-account users
- Real attendees miss out
- Organizers lose money on duplicate claims

**Token Airdrops**:
- Sybil attacks drain token allocations
- Legitimate users receive less
- Project tokenomics destroyed

**Coupons & Discounts**:
- One person claims multiple coupons
- Business loses revenue
- Fair customers miss out

**Event Ticketing**:
- Bots claim tickets
- Real fans can't attend
- Scalpers profit

### Why This Matters

**For Organizers**:
- Financial losses from duplicate claims
- Inability to fairly distribute limited resources
- Loss of trust from legitimate users

**For Users**:
- Miss out on rewards due to abuse
- Unfair competition from multi-account users
- Privacy concerns with invasive verification

**For the Ecosystem**:
- Trust erosion in reward systems
- Inefficient resource allocation
- Barriers to fair participation

## The Core Issue

**Without proof of personhood, you cannot guarantee one person = one reward.**

Any system that doesn't verify human uniqueness will be exploited by:
- Bots
- Multi-account users
- Sybil attacks
- Proxy verification

## Why WorldID is Essential

WorldID provides the missing piece: **cryptographic proof of human uniqueness** without revealing identity.

### What WorldID Solves

✅ **One Person = One WorldID**: Cryptographically guaranteed
✅ **Privacy-Preserving**: No identity revealed
✅ **Sybil-Resistant**: Cannot create multiple WorldIDs
✅ **Universal**: Works for anyone with a smartphone
✅ **Trustless**: No central authority needed

### What Happens Without WorldID

❌ **System Fails**: Multi-account abuse makes fair distribution impossible
❌ **Organizers Lose**: Resources drained by abuse
❌ **Users Suffer**: Legitimate users miss out
❌ **Trust Erodes**: System becomes unreliable

## Our Solution

The WorldID Reward Distribution System uses WorldID's proof of personhood to ensure:
- **One person = one claim per event**
- **Fair distribution** of rewards
- **Privacy-preserving** verification
- **Sybil-resistant** system

**Without WorldID, this system cannot function.** The entire architecture depends on WorldID's uniqueness guarantee. Remove WorldID, and the system becomes vulnerable to all the abuse patterns described above.

## Real-World Use Cases

### 1. Event Merchandise Distribution

**Scenario**: Limited edition event t-shirts (100 available)

**Without WorldID**: 
- Bots and multi-account users claim all 100
- Real attendees get nothing
- Organizer loses money

**With WorldID**:
- One person = one claim
- 100 real attendees get t-shirts
- Fair distribution guaranteed

### 2. Token Airdrops

**Scenario**: Project airdrops 1M tokens to early supporters

**Without WorldID**:
- Sybil attackers create 1000 accounts
- Claim 1M tokens across accounts
- Legitimate users get nothing
- Token distribution destroyed

**With WorldID**:
- One person = one airdrop
- Fair distribution to real supporters
- Sybil attacks prevented

### 3. Offline Store Coupons

**Scenario**: Store offers 50% off coupon to first 100 customers

**Without WorldID**:
- One person claims multiple coupons
- Uses them across multiple visits
- Store loses revenue
- Fair customers miss out

**With WorldID**:
- One person = one coupon
- Fair distribution to 100 real customers
- Store controls costs

### 4. Event Ticketing

**Scenario**: Exclusive event with 500 tickets

**Without WorldID**:
- Bots claim all tickets
- Real fans can't attend
- Scalpers resell at markup

**With WorldID**:
- One person = one ticket
- Real fans get tickets
- Bot prevention built-in

## Conclusion

**The problem is real**: Multi-account abuse makes fair reward distribution impossible.

**WorldID is essential**: Without proof of personhood, the system fails.

**Our solution works**: WorldID enables fair, private, sybil-resistant reward distribution.
